-when multithreadable, a generator (not effect) adding to the output buffer, or a generator/effect adding to the send buffers, must lock the access in-between LockMix_Shared / UnlockMix_Shared




history:

(10/05/00)
- rewrote almost everything, a lot of changes & splits

(15/07/00)
- changed TVoiceParams & the way the levels are handled (Voice_Render)
- added FPF_TimeWarp

(26/07/00)
- added plugin flags combo's
- removed AlphaTable from TFruityPlugingHost

(27/07/00)
- DefPoly now used

(26/09/00)
- TFruityPlugHost.MIDIOut declaration has changed
- implemented FPF_MIDITick

(27/09/00)
- added TFruityPlugHost.MIDIOut_Delayed & FPF_MIDIOut, reorganized TFruityPlugHost
- defined UseCriticalSection in FP_DelphiPlug
- updated FPE_Tempo
- added FPE_MaxPoly & FPD_KillAVoice

(11/10/00)
- added FPE_MIDI_Pan & FPE_MIDI_Vol

(01/11/00)
- updated TFruityPlugHost.Voice_Kill(Sender:Integer;KillHandle:LongBool);
  (KillHandle forces Fruity to ask back the plugin to destroy its voice, in case the plugin is still using that voice handle, or has destroyed it already, use False)

(27/11/00)
- added FPN_VoiceLevel & FPN_VoiceLevelHint to allow the plugin to define the function of the 2 extra per-voice params (filter cutoff & resonance by default)
  added FPD_UseVoiceLevels

(29/11/00)
- added TempBuffers (TFruityPlugHost)
- added AddWave_32FM_32FS_Ramp

(13/12/00)
- updated FPE_MIDI_Vol
- added FHD_ActivateMIDI

(15/12/00)
- added FPF_MIDIIn, TFruityPlug.MIDIIn

(16/12/00)
- removed FPF_MIDIIn & FPF_MIDITick, added FHD_WantMIDIInput & FHD_WantMIDITick

(19/12/00)
- added FPD_WrapPlugin and FHD_LocatePlugin

(20/12/00)
- added FHD_KillAutomation
- added FPF_DemoVersion

(21/12/00)
- added FHD_SetNumPresets, FPN_Preset, FPD_SetPreset

(02/01/01)
- added noise wavetable
- updated PM_HQ

(15/02/01)
- added FHD_VSTiIdle
- now supports FPF_UseChanSample
- added FPD_SetCustomWaveTable

(19/03/01)
- updated FPD_WrapPlugin
- added FHD_ShowPlugSelector

(18/04/O1)
- added sample loading functions

(28/04/01)
- added timing functions (FHD_TicksToTime, FPD_SongPosChanged, FPD_SetEnabled, GetMixingTime, etc.)

(2/06/01)
- added FPN_OutCtrl, NumOutCtrls
- replaced FPF_EventController by FPF_WantNewTick (now implemented)

(12/07/01)
- added FHD_LocateDataFile
- fixed the implementation of TFruityPlugHost.Voice_Release in FruityLoops

(19/07/01)
- added FHD_GetParamMenuEntry
- (!) changed CurrentSDKVersion to 1

(24/07/01)
- added some info to WaveTables & TempBuffers

(29/07/01)
- added MsgIn, PlugMsg_Delayed, etc. (for the Fruity Vibrator)

(02/08/01)
- added FPF_Hybrid
- renamed FPF_UseChanSample to FPF_GetChanCustomShape & renamed FPD_SetCustomShape to FPD_ChanSampleChanged
- added FPF_GetChanSample (so that the plugin can get the sample as a custom 32FM shape, or a 16IS sample
- added FHLS_GetName
- changed & added processing mode flags (see PM_IsRendering)
- added GetSampleInfo

(13/02/02)
- removed MixingTick & MIDITick class variables

(10/07/02)
- added FPF_WantFitTime

(29/06/02)
- increased number of temp buffers to 4

(06/05/04)
- added FHLS_NoResampling

(18/07/04)
- added FPF_NewVoiceParams
  HOW TO UPDATE TO THIS:
  Step 1: Add FPF_NewVoiceParams to your plugin flags
  Step 2: Adapt your code so that you read the pitch & panning as floats instead of integers. Pitch is still in cents, and panning is in -1..1
  Note: ComputeLRVol was changed to ComputeLRVol_Old, and ComputeLRVol has been adapted to accept a -1..1 float panning parameter

(08/11/04)
- changed FPD_SetNumSends

(31/12/04)
- added FPD_SetSamplesPerTick

(21/03/05)
- added FPV_GetLength and FPV_GetColor for a plugin to retrieve voice color & length

(16/05/05)
- added (GM) and (G) comments telling from which thread(s) functions can be called
- added TFruityPlugHost.LockPlugin

(08/03/06)
- added FPF_IsDelphi

(02/11/06)
- added FPV_GetVelocity, FPV_GetRelVelocity, FPV_GetRelTime and FPV_SetLinkVelocity

(23/12/08)
- added FHD_GetNumInOut, GetInBuffer, GetOutBuffer, FPD_RoutingChanged
- GetInsBuffer now cannot use Ofs=0 (could bring problems)
So, GetInsBuffer, GetInBuffer & GetOutBuffer use Indexes that start at 1, 0 meaning the buffer during rendering

(27/01/09)
- added FHD_FloatAutomation, FPD_GetParamInfo, FPD_ProjLoaded, FPD_WrapperLoadState, FPD_ShowSettings, FPF_WantSettingsBtn

(02/11/11)
- MsgIn, PlugMsg_Delayed, PlugMsg_Kill are now deprecated. DO NOT USE THEM!
